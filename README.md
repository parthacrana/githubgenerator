This is the readme file for the personal blog challenge! Week 5 challenge 9! 

This repo contains both the javascript file for the Read Me Generator!

Feel free to explore any or all of these files! 



Basic code was added already, just had to add the javascript and some questions for user input via Inquirer module. 

Used Inquirer@8.2.4 and FS



One thing I was still unable to was generate the read me file. I have the format for the readme.md file but it is not generating.

If I do not solve it by tonight, then I will turn the assignment again at a later date after everything is cleared up. 

P.S. Thanks to my new Javascript book!
